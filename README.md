Part 1: To Do List Application

For the main part of this week's homework, you're going to be creating a to do list application using what we've learned in the last week: Node.js, Express and Express routes, and jQuery's AJAX method.

Create a to do list application that matches the mobile and desktop designs below:





You will need to use Font Awesome for the icons. The font used is Roboto from Google Fonts. You will also need to include jQuery in your application.


You need to meet the following requirements


Use array methods instead of for loops
Make a GET route for getting all todo list items
Make a POST route for adding a new todo list item
Make a DELETE route for deleting a todo list item using the X button next to it
Make a PUT route for updating a todo list item when it is checked or unchecked
Modularize your routes by seperating your Express routes into a seperate route file
No global variables other than functions and state (front-end)
Use a single render function to render items to the page (front-end)
Use AJAX (part of the jQuery library) to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests from the front-end
Deploy the final application to Heroku and submit two links: a Heroku link and your Github repo link


Next week we will be adding a database so that our to do entries will be stored even if the server application is reset.
